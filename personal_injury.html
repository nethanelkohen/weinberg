        While we all hope to never incur an injury caused by the fault of another, it happens and when it does, you have the right to make a claim for compensation for that injury. This can be as straightforward as a claim on the other party’s insurance for an at-fault act to a complex lawsuit involving grossly negligent or even intentionally harmful acts. If you have been injured, you need the legal support of an experienced personal injury attorney. With over 35 years as a practicing attorney, Robert Weinberg can assist you.

        When you are injured, you often face mounting medical bills that may overwhelm you. You may be unable to return to work or suffer other financial hardships due to the injury. Mr. Weinberg will get you the compensation you deserve, which often includes more than just compensation for the injury but for losses, tangible (economic) and intangible (pain and suffering or emotional distress), you may have incurred. Whether you were involved in a vehicle accident, a work accident, are a victim of medical malpractice, or suffer any other injury due to someone else’s negligence, Mr. Weinberg’s goal is to get you the highest possible recovery for your claim.

        Because almost all personal injury claims are settled out of court, you need an attorney on your side who is a skilled negotiator. Mr. Weinberg is a personable yet tough negotiator. He knows how to present your case to opposing counsel and insurance companies in a way that will maximize the value of your losses. He has negotiated hundreds of claims over the years, often with results that are beyond the client’s expectations.
