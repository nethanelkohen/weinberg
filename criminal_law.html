    <div>
      <p class="aboutus-second">It’s important to understand that being charged with a crime doesn’t mean you will be convicted of the crime. The first step to a developing a defense is examining the evidence, called “discovery” in legal parlance. Sometimes the discovery reveals
        that the requisite elements of the crime are not present. In those cases, it is possible to get the charges dismissed or, seeing that the case is weak, convince the prosecution or the court to reduce the charges. Call Attorney Weinberg at (949)
        474-9700 for a free evaluation of the discovery in your case.
      </p>
      <p class="aboutus-second">
        Mr. Weinberg has developed an expert eye for weaknesses or flaws in the prosecution’s case. Sometimes that can be a violation of your Constitutional rights which can result in the entire charge or charges being dismissed. Other times, witness statements
        are suspect or contradictory. And in other instances, the discovery may be missing key evidence that is necessary to establish the crime. There are many ways that discovery—the very evidence the prosecution relies on—can actually provide you with
        a defense to the charge.
      </p>
      <p class="aboutus-second">
        Even when the evidence is solid, there are defenses available to the criminal defendant. It takes an expert knowledge of criminal law and an understanding of the way the courts have interpreted that law to uncover defenses that may not be apparent
        to the less experienced attorney. Mr. Weinberg’s attention to the specific facts of your case and how those facts may offer a defense is key to an optimal result. Mr. Weinberg will explore all options with the ultimate goal in mind: To forcefully
        advocate for your rights under the law.
