        Robert Weinberg was born and raised in Orange County and you might say he was destined to become an Orange County lawyer. Both of his parents practiced law in the county and all of siblings are also Orange County attorneys.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p class="bob-text"> When you meet Mr. Weinberg, you will be impressed by his understanding of the law and his ability to quickly assess your matter. If you witness him argue in court or negotiate in arbitration, you will be amazed at his commanding presence and his
        ability to think on his feet.</p>
      <br><br>
      <p class="bob-text">
        His authoritative voice and skills as an orator, so readily apparent when he argues in court, were already evident as a newly minted graduate of U.S.C. when he took a job as news anchor for a local network T.V. station. He then went on to study law at
        the University of San Diego School of Law and was admitted to the California Bar in 1981.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <p class="bob-text">
        He got his first job as a lawyer working as an in-house attorney for an insurance firm. There he was introduced to personal injury law. Following that, he went to work for the Orange County District Attorney as a deputy district attorney. As a former
        prosecutor, he knows how the “other side” thinks.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <p class="bob-text">
        In ________, Mr. Weinberg opened his own office in Irvine. Today his office is located in the Atrium’s 19200 tower in Irvine, conveniently located to all of Orange County. Mr. Weinberg represents clients from all over southern California and is admitted
        to appear in any court in California.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <p class="bob-text">
        His very competent assistant, Heidi Langstaff, has been supporting Mr. Weinberg’s practice almost since the day he opened his solo practice. She will usually be the first person you speak with when you contact the office. Her friendly demeanor and helpful
        attitude conveys that attention and care every client receives. Mr. Weinberg is also assisted by a paralegal staff with expertise in legal research.
